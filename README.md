## Significance

CDC reports that over 44 million American adults have a mental health condition. The rate of youth experiencing mental health issues continue rising with 62% of teens and children who are majorly affected receiving no treatment.
The report states that 12.2% of adults with a mental illness remain uninsured and 56.4% of adults receiving no treatment at all. That’s over 24 million untreated individuals who are experiencing a mental health illness.

So why is this significant? Mental disorders play an overwhelming role in the increased risk of suicide—with estimates suggesting up to 90% of individuals who take their own life suffer from some type of psychiatric disorder.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death for individuals aged 15 to 34 and in 2017, 47,000 lives were lost to suicide—that’s one death every 11 minutes

The lack of sufficient inpatient and outpatient services as well as medical costs serve as great barriers in the fight for sanity of the mind.

Post discharge, many patients have no contact with their outpatient mental health provider until weeks or months after discharge. Establishing case management services for patients with complex mental health needs can take up to 60 or even 90 days as the referrals for services make their way through the approval process.

A severe shortage of mental health clinicians is adding to the problem.


## Our Plan

Journal for discharged patients and those who don’t have access to mental health services.
Features: Chat-bot, Journal, Calendar

The user will be able to journal their thoughts. The entry will be *examined* by AWS to customize a chat bot that the user can also use. And there is also one more thing that I can't remember


The app will give people a new way to take care of themselves, since it’s so hard to keep a therapist for forever 
This is because  "Follow-up after discharge is an effective and important intervention to reduce suicide." 
Target: people that are being reintegrated into common society (→still seeing a therapist who can view the journals, but patient isn’t totally reliant on them)

Readmission rates would be reduced by this app after discharge of patients with severe mental disorders. 
study revealed that psychiatric readmissions could be reduced by aftercare services, through the first year after discharge in patients with severe mental disorders. 

Follow-up ensures continuity of care, provides support during a time of heightened risk, and facilitates linkages to outpatient care. 
Mpx: It fills the significant gap and acts as a safety net for those at risk of suicide.
